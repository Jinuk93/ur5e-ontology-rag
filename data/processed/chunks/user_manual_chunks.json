You create, load and execute programs for the robot in\nPolyScope. The PolyScope interface is divided as shown in the following illustration:\n• A: Header with icons/tabs that make interactive screens available to you.\n• B: Footer with buttons that control your loaded program/s.\n• C: Screen with fields and options to manage and monitor robot actions.\nUsing the\nTouch\nScreen\nThe touch sensitivity is designed to avoid false selections on PolyScope, and to prevent\nunexpected motion of the robot.\nThe Teach Pendant touch screen is optimized for use in industrial environments. Unlike\nconsumer electronics, Teach Pendant touch screen sensitivity is, by design, more resistant to\nenvironmental factors such as:\n• water droplets and/or machine coolant droplets\n• radio wave emissions\n• other conducted noise from the operating environment.\nFor best results, use the tip of your finger to make a selection on the screen.\nIn this manual, this is referred to as a \"tap\".\nA commercially available stylus may be used to make selections on the screen if desired.\nUser Manual",

The load during stopping motion is independent of the stop category type.\nThe values stated in the following tables are maximum nominal loads in worst-case\nmovements multiplied with a safety factor of 2.5.

Actual operating loads are dependent on the application and robot program. You\ncan use URSim to evaluate the expected loads in your specific application.\nSafety\nmargin\ns\nYou can incorporate added safety margins, factoring in the following design considerations:\n• Static stiffness: A stand that is not sufficiently stiff will deflect during robot motion, resulting\nin the robot arm not hitting the intended waypoint or path. Lack of static stiffness can also\nresult in a poor freedrive teaching experience or protective stops.\n• Dynamic stiffness: If the frequency of the stand matches the movement frequency of the\nrobot arm, the entire system can resonate, creating the impression that the robot arm is\nvibrating. Lack of dynamic stiffness can also result in protective stops. The stand should\nhave a minimum resonance frequency of 45 Hz.\n• Fatigue: The stand shall be dimensioned to match the expected operating lifetime and load\ncycles of the complete system.\nWARNING\n• Potential for tip-over Hazards.\n• The robot arm's operational loads can cause movable platforms, such as\ntables or mobile robots, to tip over, resulting in possible accidents.\n• Prioritize safety by implementing adequate measures to prevent the\ntipping of movable platforms at all times.\nCAUTION\n• If the robot is mounted on an external axis, the accelerations of this axis\nmust not be too high.\nYou can let the robot software compensate for the acceleration of external\naxes by using script command:\nset_base_acceleration()\n• High accelerations can cause the robot to make safety stops.\nUR5e",

It is important to keep safety interface signals\nseparated from the normal I/O interface signals.\n• All safety-related signals shall be constructed redundantly (two\nindependent channels).\n• Keep the two independent channels separate so a single fault cannot lead\nto loss of the safety function.\nWARNING: ELECTRICITY\nFailure to follow any of the below can result in serious injury or death due to\nelectrical hazards.\n• Make sure all equipment not rated for water exposure remain dry. If water\nis allowed to enter the product, lockout-tagout all power and then contact\nyour local Universal Robots service provider for assistance.\n• Only use the original cables supplied with the robot only. Do not use the\nrobot for applications where the cables are subject to flexing.\n• Use caution when installing interface cables to the robot I/O.

This can be\nused in conjunction with the PWR pin to create a full circuit.\n• Sourcing: This allows the pin to be configured in a PNP or Sourcing configuration.\nWhen the output is on, the pin provides a positive voltage source (configurable in the\nIO Tab). This can be used in conjunction with the GND pin to create a full circuit.\n• Push / Pull: This allows the pin to be configured in a Push / Pull configuration. When\nthe output is on, the pin provides a positive voltage source (configurable in IO Tab).\nThis can be used in conjunction with the GND pin to create a full circuit When the\noutput is off, the pin allows a current to flow to the ground.\nAfter selecting a new output configuration, the changes take effect.

Positions and speeds are relative to the base of the robot.\nSafety\nFunction\nDescription\nJoint Position\nLimit\nSets upper and lower limits for the allowed joint positions.\nJoint Speed\nLimit\nSets an upper limit for joint speed.\nSafety\nPlanes\nDefines planes, in space, that limit robot position. Safety planes limit\neither the tool/end effector alone or both the tool/end effector and the\nelbow.\nTool\nOrientation\nDefines allowable orientation limits for the tool.\nSpeed Limit\nLimits maximum robot speed. The speed is limited at the elbow, at the\ntool/end effector flange, and at the center of the user-defined tool/end\neffector positions.\nForce Limit\nLimits maximum force exerted by the robot tool/end effector and elbow\nin clamping situations. The force is limited at the tool/end effector,\nelbow flange and center of the user-defined tool/end effector positions.\nMomentum\nLimit\nLimits maximum momentum of the robot.\nPower Limit\nLimits mechanical work performed by the robot.\nStopping\nTime Limit\nLimits maximum time the robot uses for stopping after a protective stop\nis initiated.\nStopping\nDistance\nLimit\nLimits maximum distance travelled by the robot after a protective stop is\ninitiated.\nSafety\nFunction\nWhen performing the application risk assessment, it is necessary to take into account the\nmotion of the robot after a stop has been initiated. In order to ease this process, the safety\nfunctions Stopping Time Limit and Stopping Distance Limit can be used.\nThese safety functions dynamically reduces the speed of the robot motion such that it can\nalways be stopped within the limits. The joint position limits, the safety planes and the\ntool/end effector orientation limits take the expected stopping distance travel into account\ni.e. the robot motion will slow down before the limit is reached.\nThe functional safety can be summarized as:\nUser Manual",

Pinch Hazard\nDescription\nYou can avoid pinching hazards by removing obstacles in these areas, by placing the\nrobot differently, or by using a combination of safety planes and joint limits to eliminate the\nhazards by preventing the robot moving into this area of its workspace.\nCAUTION\nPlacing the robot in certain areas can create pinching hazards that can\nlead to injury.\nDue to the physical properties of the robot arm, certain workspace areas require attention\nregarding pinching hazards. One area (left) is defined for radial motions when the wrist 1\njoint is at least 750 mm from the base of the robot. The other area (right) is within 200 mm\nof the base of the robot, when moving tangentially.\nUser Manual",

The battery service life is 8 to 10 years, but for\ne-Series and UR Series it can be replaced.\n• Flash memory can lose their data capacity over time, therefore there is a potential\nrisk that the data on e.g. the SD-card will have to re-flashed.\nUR5e",

When the external connections are Low, Reduced is initiated. Reduced\nconfiguration means that ALL reduced limits are ACTIVE.\nReduced is not a safety function, rather it is a state change affecting the settings of the following safety\nfunction limits: joint position, joint speed, TCP pose limit, TCP speed, TCP force, momentum, power,\nstopping time, and stopping distance. A reduced configuration is a means of parametrization of safety\nfunctions in accordance with ISO 13849-1.
